#Awesome Digital Humanities

> A Curated List of awesome Digital Humanities

*Awesome Digital Humanities* is concerned with finding and linking anything which might make a DH person think 'oh! awesome'. This can be a tool, a library, a paper, presentation, website, or even a twitter account. The diversity of the DH community is its strength, so there aren't strict guidelines on what or what doesn't qualify. Just ask: is this awesome?
